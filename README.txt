# Pong -v alpha 

Freatures: 
  - Prints the current state of the game. 
  - Use (Q, A) to control your paddle and (W, S) to control the computer paddle. 

Problems: 
  - The whole screen jitters. 
  - You cannot quit. 
  - You could move your paddle off the screen in which case the print_screen function will be writing to some random place in memory. (oops).
  - I don't like the size of the screen. I want more continous movement.
